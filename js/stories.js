He lives alone in Katanga slum in a one-roomed house. He developed cerebral palsy to the extent that he cannot speak, though he hears and communicates through signs and writing. He is a single father of two boys. He is very passionate about acquiring mechanical skills because of his love for cars and he wishes to start his own garage sometime in the future. Bazadde Care has helped him acquire these skills between 2020 and 2022. He spends much of his time at the garage training to acquire skills in mechanics which will enable him to support his family.",
